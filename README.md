# lenet-mnist
This is a basic introduction to convolutional neural networks (CNN). The 'doc' folder include some slides that describe the 
general architecture of a CNN classifier. Here the Caffe version of the LeNet model is used as an example for understanding some common 
layer operations. The MATLAB script 'ln_forward.m' implements the forward pass (inference) for this LeNet model.
